The read with the\r\nhighest mapping quality is kept as the non-duplicate read.\r\n\r\nFor PAIRED END reads, duplicates are marked if they fulfill the following\r\ncriteria: a) start at the same genomic coordinate b) have the same template\r\nlength c) have the same molecular tag sequence. The read pair with the highest\r\nmapping quality is kept as the non-duplicate read.\r\n\r\nHere are the two cases for running this tool:\r\n\r\n- CASE 1 (Standard): User supplies two input files,\r\n 1) SAM/BAM file that a) ends with .sam or .bam extension b) contains unique\r\n    alignments only\r\n 2) FASTQ file (ie: the Index FASTQ) that contains the molecular tag sequence\r\n    for each read name in the corresponding SAM/BAM file as either a) the read\r\n    sequence or b) in the FASTQ entry header name. If the index FASTQ read\r\n    length is 6, 8, 12, 14, or 18nt long as expected for NuGEN products, the\r\n    molecular tag sequence to be extracted from the read according to -s and -l\r\n    parameters, otherwise the molecular tag will be extracted from the header\r\n    of the FASTQ entry.\r\n\r\n- CASE 2 (Runtime Optimized): User supplies only one input file,\r\n 1) SAM/BAM file that a) ends with .sam or .bam extension b) contains unique\r\n    alignments only c) is sorted d) has a fixed length sequence containing the\r\n    molecular tag appended to each read name.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Anand Patel\r\nContact: NuGEN Technologies Inc., techserv@nugen.com\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n  IN.sam|IN.bam         input sorted/unsorted SAM/BAM containing only unique\r\n                        alignments (sorted required for case 2 detailed above)\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -2, --paired-end      use paired end deduping with template.
